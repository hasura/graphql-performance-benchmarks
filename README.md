# GraphQL Performance Benchmarks

This repo will contain various benchmark setups that users can replicate to analyze the performance characteristics of DIY GraphQL Servers and Hasura's GraphQL Engine.

Tests will be done for different workloads, different data sources (like PostgreSQL, Oracle etc) and different querying use cases.
